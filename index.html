            <p>Hello</p>
            <p>This is my corner of the internet, i usually just want something like this to post my autistic ramblings, and to plug whatever i'm working on.</p>
            <p>you might've noticed the site is very work in progress at the moment, only intend to fuck around with CSS after i've organized everything, so its gonna look like this for a while</p>

                <p>Hello</p>
                <p>This is my corner of the internet, i usually just want something like this to post my autistic ramblings, and to plug whatever i'm working on.</p>
                <p>you might've noticed the site is very work in progress at the moment, only intend to fuck around with CSS after i've organized everything, so its gonna look like this for a while</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello, i'm Null. I'm a "Hobbyist" 3d artist, musician and game developer. I spend way too much of my time tinkering with things and not finishing anything. My passions include mid 2000s era level design, grunge, electronic music of all kinds and old outdated creation software</p>
                <p>You can usually contact me on my twitter profile (link below) or just follow me on my other social media accounts if cyber-stalking is more your thing</p>

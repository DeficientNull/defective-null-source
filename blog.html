                <h2>My anxieties with development</h2>
                <p>i've noticed myself go back and forth between two stages of making things</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>get really excited about something, plan a lot, think nothing will go wrong because this time i can control my own mind</li>
                    <li>well i can't control my own mind, and now i'm spending all this time doing things peripheral to the thing i like doing, rather than doing the thing itself</li>
                </ol>
                <p>and of course i think of taking a break, but what always happens is i take too long of a break, and motivation never comes back. </p>
                <p>I think now that i've started really noticing this is why i feel really frustrated by it, and why i'm still just working at it anyway even if the risk of burning out is real</p>
                <p>I like working on stuff, i LOVE working on stuff - but sometimes it feels like my brain hijacks this feeling and the project with it, and i'm not sure what to do about it. I just know i need to stop being so inconsistent, cause everytime i do good things generally come from it. Just feel stuck in general i suppose</p>
                <p>Current project i'm working on has a lot of waiting involved, and not the good kind. Asking questions when using this kind of tookit feels like wasting people's time, i should just be able to read the documentation and example code and figure it out, but i can't so every time i ask a question i feel like i'm enabling a ticking time bomb, cause eventually people will get fed up with my bullshit and won't answer anymore and i'm fucked.</p>
                <p>There are upsides of course, so much of this toolset already does literally everything i've ever wanted when it comes to handling assets, it's honestly a dream come true when it comes to that. And people seem to be really impressed by what i've managed to cook up with it on a fairly short amount of time.</p>
                <p>idk, guess i just needed to vent</p>
